> The aim is to define the correct definition of the bare affinity weights ω(α) such that the topological weight (given by Eq.(3)) associated to each node of the simplicial complex is equal to the number of papers written by the corresponding author.

> Our goal is to define a proper measure of the strength of the collaboration ω(α) associated to the simplices of K_d, so that the topological weights defined recursively by Eq. (3) attribute to each node a topological weight given by the number of the paper they have co-authored.

 It is easily verified from case
(c) that the bare affinity weight of a link can be obtained by
subtracting the topological weight of the link by the sum of
the topological weights of the triangles incident to it.
